#AngularJs, CoffeeScript, Play2 and Reactive Mongo

This application shows how to build a 'modern' web application, comprising of a Clientside Javascript App built using
``AngularJS`` wrote in ``CoffeeScript``, served from the ``Play Framework`` and using document persistence with
``Reactive Mongo`` a non-blocking Scala client for ``MongoDB``.

Sounds like a cool stack, well i think so!  In this tutorial, I'm going to cover how to structure an AngularJS app,
expose a Rest Api in Play and Read/Write Json Documents in MongoDB.  By the end we will have created a simple User
management app which gives a thin slice of Entity management, collecting data in the Angular app and persisting in MongoDB.

#Structure
Let me begin by showing the overall structure of the application we are building.

That's all folks...
